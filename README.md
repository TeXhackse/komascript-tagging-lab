The full KOMA-Script repository is located at https://sf.net/projects/koma-script/.

## How to use this bundle

Please ensure to use an up to date LaTeX installation!

We currently are trying to have some kind of patchin mechanism to support [Ulrike Fischer's tagpdf](https://github.com/latex3/tagpdf) withing KOMA-Script. Therefore this Bundle is creating a package to adjust the settings.

Currently the setup is still a bit complex but that's under development. Within the `tagging-experiments` directory you find example files to see how to load the package. These files also include some debugging output to compare the structure to the those created by tagpdf itself.

## Installation

It's possible to run the bundle without installation. By default the l3build script is configured to only run all experiment and testfiles when you call

```
l3build doc
```

the actul documentation is not created as the this would require the full KOMA-Script bundle to be built.

This will build all `*.tex` files within the tagging-experiments directory.

To use the package outside of this structure it's possible install the bundle within the user's texmfhome directory using

```
l3build install
```
